# Inventory
An application to manage a small inventory and keep a record of the sales made.

For the proper functioning of the app, these steps must be followed:

For Backend:
    1 - Open the 'Shop' folder from a development environment and launch the console.
    2 - Enter the following commands in the terminal or command line:
        A - php artisan migrate
        B - php artisan serve

For Frontend:
    1 - Open the 'store' project in another window of the development environment and launch the command-line terminal.
    2 - Enter the following commands in the terminal or command line:
        A - npm install
        B - npm i vue
        C - npm run dev

Open the web browser with the URL provided by the frontend development environment window. It typically looks like this: 
    http://localhost:8080


And now you can view the designed application; Laravel for the server (backend) and Vue for the browser (frontend).
